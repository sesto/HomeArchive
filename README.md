This is a small web application developed mainly for learning purposes. It performs CRUD operations with any kind of digital content using MongoDB and GridFS format. Searching DB is implemented via Elasticsearch.

The frontend is build with AngularJS framework.
For the file upload [angular-file-upload](https://github.com/nervgh/angular-file-upload) module has been used.

A very nice example of [AngularJS-REST-Spring Security](https://github.com/philipsorst/angular-rest-springsecurity) was used to write the using login module
